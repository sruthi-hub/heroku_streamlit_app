**Spatial Network Entropy Calculator**

https://network-entropy-calculator.streamlit.app/

This application is a streamlit-based Network Entropy Calculator that takes in two files containing the nodelist and edgelist separately, and returns a spatial network entropy value. 

Nodelist should have two columns: 'Ensembl_id' and 'Expression value'; 
Edgelist should have two columns: 'Source' and 'Target'. 

Example files are provided here as sample_nodelist.csv and sample_edgelist.csv

**Abstract:**

Aging is accompanied by disrupted information flow, resulting from accumulation of molecular mistakes. These mistakes ultimately give rise to debilitating disorders including skeletal muscle wasting, or sarcopenia. To derive a global metric of growing ‘disorderliness’ of aging muscle, we employed a statistical physics approach to estimate the state parameter, entropy, as a function of genes associated with hallmarks of aging. Escalating network entropy reached an inflection point at old age, while structural and functional alterations progressed into oldest-old age. To probe the potential for restoration of molecular ‘order’ and reversal of the sarcopenic phenotype, we systemically overexpressed the longevity protein, Klotho, via AAV. Klotho overexpression modulated genes representing all hallmarks of aging in old and oldest-old mice, but pathway enrichment revealed directions of changes were, for many genes, age-dependent. Functional improvements were also age-dependent. Klotho improved strength in old mice, but failed to induce benefits beyond the entropic tipping point.
